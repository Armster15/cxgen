        It's been a while (like a year) 
        but I have made some new (more like big) 
        changes to cxgen!
        
        - There is now a GUI! (cxgen will now be more focused on a GUI converter)
        - cxgen stil uses the 2.0.0 framework, it's  just rebranded as cxgenLegacy
        - Some changes to the framework so that it could support the GUI
        - Python 2 is no longer supported - only Python versions 3+ are supported
        
        ## How to use cxgen
        **To run the GUI:** `from cxgen import GUI`
        
        ### Legacy
        To run the legacy based console application: 
        
            from cxgen.Legacy import app
            app()
        
        To run the legacy method to generate cx_Freeze setup code:
        
            from cxgen.Legacy import run
            run()
